Two days of interesting talks about the current state of the art and the future of ecommerce with international speakers from all fields.
An event that allows interdisciplinary and fascinating chats between developers, merchants, partners, and many more.
That has been the Commerce Summit 2017 hosted by [epages](https://www.epages.com/) in Hamburg.
The [agenda](https://www.commerce-summit.com/en/agenda/) was separated into three tracks:
* Technology-Track
* Merchant-Track
* Strategy-Track

## Let's focus on the tech stuff

The Tech-Track started with a presentation of our CTO Harm Behrens, presenting our new API-first product ePages NOW.
During the presentation he stressed out the importance of microservices for a well-working and innovative product.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="de"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/netzfisch">@netzfisch</a> is introducing our API-First approach of our new <a href="https://twitter.com/epages">@epages</a> architecture. Room is packed! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/commercesummit?src=hash">#commercesummit</a> <a href="https://t.co/0tyDAQ60vs">pic.twitter.com/0tyDAQ60vs</a></p>&mdash; Jens Fischer (@jensfischerhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/jensfischerhh/status/910795524508352512">21. September 2017</a></blockquote>

After this overview of the current development status at ePages, two of our ePages developers took over and gave further insights into the micro- and macro-architecture of our microservices system.
Another talk dealt with the customization of an onlineshop using CSS and different settings for themes.
This way, customers can adapt their shops to their personal taste or company guidelines easily.
The talk was followed by a live coding session of a [Python app](ttps://github.com/ooz/epages-rest-python-examples/tree/master/beautiful_order_documents) against the API of ePages [NOW](https://developer.epages.com/apps) and [Beyond](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/new-docu-epages/index.html).

Already sounds interesting to you?
That's not all!
The first day ended with an exiting topic that took up the ongoing discussion of the future of ecommerce.
How will it look like?
Which devices will be used?
One of our ePages developers had a chat with [Amazons Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa) and enabled her to assist a merchant with organizing their onlineshop.
Alexa informed about incoming orders in detail and was able to process them according to the merchants wishes.
Cool stuff, isn't it?

## Party time

After such an interesting and successful first day, we had several reasons to celebrate.
ePages had its 30. birthday AND ePages NOW was finally launched after years of hard work.
To bring the crowd in the right mood, we had a [fantastic act from Reeperbahn festival](http://betsymusic.co.uk/).

## The day after

The second day started just like the first one ended.
Luis Gomes went even one step further than a voice activated assistant like Alexa and had a look at the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/).
He created a scenario of a customer looking for a new tv using a HoloLens.
The customer was able to have a 3D view of the tv and get relevant information right next to it.
To make this possible, Gomes even admitted having installed Windows - on his MAC!
So, playing around with the HoloLens really seems to be fun.

Besides this futuristic talk, there have been some others during the day.
For example, [Aruba cloud](https://www.arubacloud.com/), [Shipcloud](https://www.shipcloud.io/), and [Honico](https://www.honico.com/en/home.html) presented their products and possibilities for developers.
And let's not forget all the other interesting talks of the other two tracks.
If you wanted to see them all, you had a tough time schedule.

## Time for a breather

Sitting in a room and listening to a speaker might be exhausting over time.
Luckily, there have been some side activities to free the minds.
So why not try to beat national player [Oke Harms](https://www.kickerkult.de/epages/61190833.sf/de_DE/?ObjectPath=Categories) in table football?
Or find your own rhythm on the [drums](http://bodrum-webshop.de/)?
Or just have a chat with the exhibitors after filling your tummy with delicious food?
It was up to everybody to shape their day.

## The kebab case

Getting together so many people from different areas lead to an intensive exchange of opinions and ideas.
The direct contact between ePagees, merchants, partners and other developers allowed interesting discussions at the bar tables and a mixed audience in the talks.
Thus, a non-developer like me for example finally got to know the kebab case while listening to one of the Tech-Track talks and developers had to think about sex and shopping when listening to Graham Jones in the Strategy-Track.
Who would have thought that before?

So, I'm already looking forward to the next Commerce Summit and so should you!

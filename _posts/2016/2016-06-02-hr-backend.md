In the last months, you learned about what it’s like to be a [Ruby Developer](https://developer.epages.com/blog/2016/02/04/hr-ruby.html), a [Java Developer](https://developer.epages.com/blog/2016/03/01/hr-java.html) or a [QA engineer](https://developer.epages.com/blog/2016/04/12/hr-quality-assurance.html) at ePages in Hamburg.
Now it's time to ask a software developer in Jena about his daily work there.

## Here's his story:

Hello, my name is David, and I'm 29 years old.
I'm working as Software Developer at ePages since September 2014.

### How did you get to know ePages?

When looking for jobs on the internet, I came across a job ad for a Java Developer position at ePages.
I applied for the job, and had a Skype interview with Mario Rieß, the Senior Vice President of R&D.
We talked about some general topics, and I was then invited for a personal interview.
I was also asked to solve a specific coding challenge related to Java and MySQL.

Well, and in that interview, I figured out, that I would have to code in PERL.
Interesting, because the job ad had been advertised for Java {% emoji wink %}.

But however, working at ePages in Jena was the best choice!
And I will change to a newly established Java team in July.

### What are your main tasks?

Together with my team colleagues, I'm responsible for adding new features to the ePages software as well as maintaining it.
I'm in close contact with the support team in Hamburg, as they receive the feedback from our merchants on shop behaviour, problems, or new customer demands.
Furthermore, I'm writing Selenium tests to check, if all the new features work properly.

### But besides that, you do a lot of other tasks. You're everywhere, aren't you?

What should I say?
I enjoy these task very much, and I'm used to multi-tasking {% emoji wink %}.

For example, keeping information up-to-date is important to me: either when it comes to documenting our code or cleaning up Confluence, the company intranet.

Since the beginning of the year, I also organise the ePages Partner Training.
I restructured the agenda, and adapted it to new requirements.
The main aim is to approach partners as well as potential app developers, and train them how to work with the ePages REST API.
Next to this, I develop a PHP SDK for our REST API, that I also use for training purpose during the partner workshops.

So, yeah, I pretty much like to bring fresh motivation, and I'm interested in improving stuff.

### What does a typical work day look like?

I'm the early bird in the team.
My work day starts at around 7:00 to being able to work on my tasks without any disturbances.
I check the pipeline, and work through tasks on our Jira board.

At 11:00 we have our daily standup.
If there are no other meetings planned, I continue my work until lunch time.
Usually, we order something, as there are no good restaurants around.

In the afternoon, I work on Talisma tickets, and finish work at around 16:00.

### Can you say a few words about the communication between Jena and Hamburg?

We have a very good communication via HipChat.
I'm connected in all the team rooms, and receive a lot of information there.
So I'm up-to-date most of the time.

Furthermore, we use Google Hangouts to connect with the teams in Hamburg or Barcelona.
Every Friday, we have our R&D status meeting, where we exchange the week's important topics.

### What do you like at ePages?

ePages is like a family.
That's awesome!

I like the cooperation with other teams.
You can give feedback to everyone, bring your own ideas, and people listen to you.

We have the option to do offsite meetings, which always turn out to be very productive and strengthen the team.

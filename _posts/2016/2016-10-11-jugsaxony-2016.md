## Starting off

On September 30th, the success-proven JAVA conference [JUG Saxony Day](http://www.jug-saxony-day.org/) started off with a great opening talk by Martin Duli, the Minister of Economics of Saxony.
He spoke about the needs and enablers for an industry 4.0, innovation and digitalization, as well as important parts of his AIDA program.

This year's conference was divided into five tracks: processes, enterprise technologies, java, architecture, and special topics.
The Radisson Hotel in Dresden, Germany, offered a great location for many exciting presentations to over 400 developers from near and far.
Over a dozen exhibitors and a whole hotel crew ensured a comfortable setting during the short breaks.

## It's all about JDK 9

Starting with the keynote "Prepare for JDK 9!" my colleague Bastian and I visited all three very insightful Java talks by Oracle.
The speakers, all Java project leaders, outlined the new features of JDK 9 and emphasized the final steps of the project roadmap until the final release in early 2017.
Dalibor Topic provided a high level view, Wolfgang Weigand focused on the modularization (JSR 376) with Project Jigsaw ([link to presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/wolfgangweigend/jdk-9-und-die-modulare-plattform-jigsaw)), and Sean Coffey dived deeper into the technical implementation details of a variety of enhancements.
An excerpt:

### Modularization

[JEP 200](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/200): Modular JDK

[JEP 201](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/201): Reorganize the JDK source code into modules

[JEP 220](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/220): Introduce modular run-time images

* new runt-time image structure introduces conf dir, and removes libs like rt.jar or tools.jar
* jimage - list and extract modules

[JEP 260](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/260): Encapsulate most internal APIs

* no access to most internal APIs anymore (exception: sun.misc.Unsafe)
* jdeps inspects your project for such deprecated dependencies

[JEP 261](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/261): Implement the module system

[JEP 282](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/282): jlink and mlib - tools to assemble and optimize modules

### Garbage collector

[JEP 158](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/158): Unified JVM Logging

[JEP 271](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/271): Unified GC Logging

[JEP 189](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/189): Reduce GC pause times

[JEP 248](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/248): G1 is now default

### Other enhancements

[JEP 223](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/223): New versioning scheme for JDK

[JEP 247](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/247): Compile for older platform versions

[JEP 222](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/222): jshell in jdk9/bin - Finally there is a native REPL for Java, too!

[JEP 238](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/238): Include jar files with different versions in your project

[JEP 269](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/269): Introduce more convenience factory methods for collections

## Our presentation and other talks

Bastian and I presented the ecosystem around our Elastic stack for test aggregation in the ePages delivery pipeline.

In other talks we gained profound insights into Kotlin (a better JVM language) and the Netflix OSS stack, which is also used in our microservices architecture.

## Summary

We are very happy to have been part of such a well-organized conference.
If you are a Java developer, we can totally recommend to make a big mark for this conference in your calendar for next year!
See you there!
